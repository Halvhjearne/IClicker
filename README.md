An app for assetto corsa to allow audible indicator clicks and more by Halvhjearne

http://www.twitch.tv/halvhjearne

this is a free app and may not be used in any commercial way without written permission from Halvhjearne.

it is a bit of a crude way to implement it but it works and forgive me if it could have been written it a bit better, but as this is like the second script i ever wrote in lua, i think i did ok.

To install click the green code icon and press dowload zip, open the zip file and find the apps folder, now drop that into your assetto corsa root folder and you are done.

Known problems: 
if app is closed the script will stop running, to fix restart game after closing the window or minimize only. (csp bug in version <= 0.1.78, should be fixed next csp update) 

Special thanks to kirkalef and RobPawn for testing and adding soundfx and everyone else who helped me testing.
