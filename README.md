# IClicker
An app for assetto corsa to allow audible indicator clicks and more by Halvhjearne

this is a bit of a crude way to implement it but it works and forgive me if it could have been written it a bit better, but as this is like the second script i ever wrote in lua, i think i did ok.

To install drop the apps folder into assetto corsa root folder.

Known problems: if app is closed the script will stop running, to fix restart game after closing or minimize only

Special thanks to kirkalef and RobPawn for testing and adding soundfx and everyone else who helped me testing
